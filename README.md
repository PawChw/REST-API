# Laravel REST API

Created as part of university assignment: "Laravel REST API"

With prior knowledge about Laravel limited to guide on how to install it I had to:
1. Configure project using [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/configuration)
2. Create [controller](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/controllers) using documentation with CRUD endpoints and additional READ all that will return all records
3. Create People class that should except required fields contain at least firs name, last name, phone number, street and city/country.
4. Prepare [migration](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/migrations) containing 200 random generated instances of People class using faker tool.
 
It then was tested and worked according to expectations, only issue mentioned was "correct but not best http response code"
